However, the algorithm is deterministic and will guarantee that no collisions will occur.\n\nThe URL alphabet is fully customizable and may contain any number of characters.  By default, digits and lower-case letters are used, with some removed to avoid confusion between characters like o, O and 0.  The default alphabet is shuffled and has a prime number of characters to further improve the results of the algorithm.\n\nThe block size specifies how many bits will be shuffled. The lower BLOCK_SIZE bits are reversed.  Any bits higher than BLOCK_SIZE will remain as is. BLOCK_SIZE of 0 will leave all bits unaffected and the algorithm will simply be converting your integer to a different base.\n\nThe intended use is that incrementing, consecutive integers will be used as keys to generate the short URLs.  For example, when creating a new URL, the unique integer ID assigned by a database could be used to generate the URL by using this module.  Or a simple counter may be used.  As long as the same integer is not used twice, the same short URL will not be generated twice.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall the module:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install shortr\n```\n\nTry it out on the command line:\n\n```bash\n$ node\n$ var shortr = require('shortr');\n$ var encoded = shortr.encode_url(1);\n$ console.log(encoded)\n$ > nMvz6\n```\n\n## Known Issues\n\n1. The code seems to break for number larger than 10737418239.\n1. Comments are not very good\n1. Test suite is not present at the moment\n\n\n## Todo\n\n* Decode Mechanism(should be simple enough)\n* Solve large number issues(like > 10737418239[2^32])\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNONE as of now!\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is just an experiment(at least at the moment), please contribute to make it better, and fee free to use it as you please.\n\n## License\n\n### The MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Samuel Vijaykumar\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
